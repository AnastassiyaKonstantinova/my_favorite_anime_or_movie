Hello everyone, it's a small project that I thought of for us to collaborate on. I'll add one of my favorite films and anime, you can then make a pull request, add yours and push it so we can all see and participate. May be you'll find a cool new thing to see, or may be you'll find someone to talk about common interests. I'll go first
